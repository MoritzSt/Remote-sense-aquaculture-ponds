# Remote-sense-aquaculture-ponds

__Literature__
there are quite a few papers on this, going back 20 years or so. Quite a few with Sentinel-2 data. Haven't found any studies beyond the national level, and there quite a few in China.
It seems a global assessment would be novel. Also wondering how this could be matched to other social, economic or environmental data. For example, distance of pond to market (nearest big city or port). Perhaps to MPA locations. This would need some more thought.
